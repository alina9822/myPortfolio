    ," My academic journey has been a mix of challenges and growth. While some subjects were tough early on, my final two years were transformative. I developed interest in subjects like software engineering, computer architecture, microprocessors, networking, bioinformatics, security, graph theory, algorithms, and machine learning. This shift not only reignited my enthusiasm but also reflected positively in my results—a rewarding academic comeback."

My technical foundation has been strengthened through hands-on coding and collaborative development."
